    description = After the success of the DTH-250 "Ovoid" Experimental Habitation Unit and DTH-375 "Ellipsoidal" Experimental Habitation Unit, Rising Horizons LLC decided that their next iteration of fuel tank-based habitation units ought to not come into this world by some sort of accident. When Kerbals make plans, the Kraken laughs. A mock-up variant of the DTH-375 "Ellipsoidal" Experimental Habitation Unit was taken home by one of the systems engineers so that she could get her kids' unique perspectives of what luxuries these sorts of units ought to hold for Kerbals on long-haul missions and definitely not just because it's fun to be in a massive bouncy house. After this engineer and her wife retired for the evening, their kids snuck out and reinflated the module for some midnight mischief; unfortunately, they overfilled the mock-up. However, by the grace of el Segador himself, the mock-up didn't explode. Instead, it held its shape. From there, the "experiment" was replicated mulitple times (with almost none of them exploding, according to our lawyers) and the DTH-500 "Ovaliform" Experimental Habitation Unit. WARNING: Your DTH-500 "Ovaliform" Experimental Habitation Unit may include various pieces of promotional material and be previously used at a trade show.
