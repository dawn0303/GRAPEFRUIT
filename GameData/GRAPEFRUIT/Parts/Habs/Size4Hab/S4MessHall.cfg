    description = Based off of the success of the DTH-500 "Ovaliform" Experimental Habitation Unit, world-renouned chef Alton Kerbrown was hired to convert the aforementioned habitat into an onboard restaurant to help with crew morale on those long-haul flights to Duna and further. Featuring the finest thermonuclear-powered refrigerators and microwaves contracted from AtomicTech Inc. (WARNING: Any rations stored in these units may be subject to neutron bombardment), the best in Kerbonaut caffeine-free coffee (WARNING: Due to supply chain shortages, your coffee may be substituted for the Whistance Farms Morning Hot DrinkTM), and plenty of seating (WARNING: Seating not guaranteed to work in zero-gravity), the MHS-500 "Mando" Portable Mess Hall Module is a must-have for any surface base or mothership.
