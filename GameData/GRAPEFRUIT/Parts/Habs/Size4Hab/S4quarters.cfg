    manufacturer = Rising Horizons LLC
    description = After repeated complaints by kerbonauts that they were forced to sleep next to empty packets of fish & kerbaroni or kept awake by the mysterious hum of knock-off mystery goo, Rising Horizons LLC (after dragging their feet in red-tape and bureaucracy after the "Hi Bob" Incident) built the MLR-500 "Casita" Somnolence Treatment Unit to give kerbonauts their much needed space from other kerbonauts and other undesirable object when they're asleep. WARNING: The MLR-500 "Casita" Somnolence Treatment Unit is required to include some sort classical music speaker on any sleeping units by law. So if that isn't your thing, then Rising Horizons LLC EarPlugsTM can be included at no additional cost, just pay shipping and handling.
