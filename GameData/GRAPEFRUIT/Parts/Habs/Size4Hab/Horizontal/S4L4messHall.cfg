    description = After winning a Kertalian restaurant chain in a legal dispute over the MHS-500 "Mando" Portable Mess Hall Module against AtomicTech Inc.'s Kuisine Research Laboratories (who claimed that they owned the design for the MHS-500 "Mando" Portable Mess Hall Module because they'd purchased the rights to Alton Kerbrown's TV Show "Kool Eats" where in one episode Kerbrown went to space in a Jebediah's Junkyard-brand Jeb-o-Tron Snacker that looks weirdly like the MHS-500), our engineers got straight to work installing hidden Kertalian scent generators in their already existing, yet unreleased, MHS-S4P "Luigi" Horizontal Mess Hall Module for crew morale. After protests from Kerbonauts that their food didn't taste like Kertalian food, Rising Horizons LLC decided to use freeze-dried meals from their new restaurant chain but somehow winding up contracting out to AtomicTech Inc.'s Kuisine Research Laboratories because their freeze-driers only tasted minimally of Blutonium-238. Small world, isn't it?
