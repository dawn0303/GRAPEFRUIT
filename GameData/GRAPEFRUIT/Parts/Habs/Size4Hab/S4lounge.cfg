    description = A number of years ago, there was an honest effort to film a television show in space.	However, the company in charge of supplying the rockets and modules was consistently over-budget and blowing past deadlines. Gerry Kerbfield, the creator of the television show, shopped the show around for a few years after that before eventually giving up. When he did, he put all of the sketches for the sets and schematics for the modules up for auction. Rising Horizons LLC, riding the new-found fame and fortune of their previous modules, immediately put in a bid twice as high as the rest of the competition with only one second left to go at the end of the auction. Now fairly broke, Rising Horizons LLC immediately got to work manufacturing the MHU-500R "Pladoh" Advanced Recreational Unit. To make things even better, Gerry Kerbfield bought some stock in the company and set-out to make his Kerbfield show a reality!
