this mod is designed to simulate the concept of the External Tank Station, an old proposal to use discarded shuttle tanks as large habitats

the mod currently comes with habs for 5m tanks, with 3.75m and 2.5m planned

current roadmap > https://trello.com/b/HotZGiLM/grapefruit <

to use this mod, mount a conversion module to the bottom of the tank you want to convert, then attach the desired habitats to the converter, and assemble them when the tank has drained

(we're on the honor system right now y'all so don't go using those habs until the fuel is out ok?)

now currently the mod adds converters and inflatable habs, the plan eventually is to have a module make sure the tank is empty, but im not really at that level so any offers of help would be much appreciated!
hope y'all enjoy! any feedback is greatly appreciated!
